# Introduction
This project focuses on designing a method which can alleviate traffic congestion in a 3-D environment. The algorithms used in this project were inspired by tradional foraging techniques.

The questions addressed in this project were:

1. Can a collision avoidance techinque be implemented effectively?

2. Can the paraemeters implemented in the collision avoidance algorithm be optimised?

3. At what point does the object density start to influence the alorithm?

4. Can the results be statistically quantified?

The python file to run the simulation is called 'final_congestion.py'

The associated R-script '462.RMD' was used to perform statistical analysis on the data.

All the data files needed to run the R-script are within the zipped folder.
